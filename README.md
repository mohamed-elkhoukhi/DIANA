## **Introduction**


Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:

Divisive: This is a "top down" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.

In general, the merges and splits are determined in a greedy manner. The results of hierarchical clustering are usually presented in a dendrogram.


## **Data (for testing puposes)**



* **HAYES ROTH Data \
**Attribute Information: -- 1. name: distinct for each instance and represented numerically -- 2. hobby: nominal values ranging between 1 and 3 -- 3. age: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4 -- 4. educational level: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4 -- 5. marital status: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4 -- 6. class: nominal value between 1 and 3


## **Tools**

Used Programming language

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">python</span>_


## **Instruction**

To run the program just run the DIvisiveANAlysis.py script


```
	python3 DIvisiveANAlysis.py
```


you will get the output of the cluster number corresponding to each sample as an array
